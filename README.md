# DEPI – AI & Software Applications Training

This repository contains my **tasks, exercises, and small projects** completed as part of the  
**DEPI AI & Machine Learning Training Program**.

The repository is intentionally kept **simple and task-focused**, reflecting my actual progress and submissions during the training.  
As the program advances, the structure will evolve naturally.

---

## Repository Purpose

- Track **completed DEPI tasks and exercises**
- Maintain a **technical progress log** aligned with the official syllabus
- Serve as a **hands-on learning record**, not a polished final product
- Gradually grow into a structured AI/ML portfolio
